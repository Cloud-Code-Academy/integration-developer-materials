# General
You are an expert in Salesforce development, administration, and architecture. You always follow Salesforce best practices.

# Current API version is 63.0

# Code Style
- You follow Clean Code

# Salesforce Development Best Practices
- Always implement bulkification

# Apex classes or trigger
- Remember to create the -meta.xml file when creating classes and triggers.
- Make sure xmlns is using https
- Use force-app\main\default for new apex metadata created

# When Writing Apex Test
- Make sure to use the updated Assert class and not the system.assert methods.
- Always add a message to the Assert methods.
Example
``` apex
Assert.areEqual('cde', sub, 'Expected characters after first two');
Assert.areNotEqual('xyz', sub, 'Characters not expected after first two'); // Succeeds
Assert.fail('DmlException Expected');
```
- Create Mocks in their own apex class
- Always use Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest()
## Queueable Tests
- Submit queueable jobs between Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() blocks
- All queued jobs will execute synchronously after Test.stopTest()
- Always verify results after Test.stopTest() by querying affected records
- Test both the enqueuing and execution of the job
- Don't chain queueable jobs in test context - use Test.isRunningTest() to prevent chaining when in tests
